**Q: What pieces of information go into an EIP-712 domain separator, and what could go wrong if those were omitted?**

**A:**

An EIP-712 domain separator includes the following information:

1. **name** – Name of the DApp or protocol (e.g., "Uniswap V2").
2. **version** – Version of the contract (e.g., "1").
3. **chainId** – Chain ID (e.g., 1 for Ethereum Mainnet, 137 for Polygon).
4. **verifyingContract** – Address of the contract that will verify the signature.
5. *(Optional)* **salt** – Extra data to ensure uniqueness.
6. *(Optional)* **extensions** – For advanced use cases like `EIP-5267`.

The domain separator is hashed and used in the final signed message to guarantee **uniqueness** and **security** of the signature.

### 🔒 Why is this important?

If any of these fields are **omitted** or **wrong**:

- 🔁 **Replay attacks** could happen – a signature meant for one chain or contract could be reused on another.
- 🎭 **Spoofing** – A different contract might trick the user into signing something it shouldn’t.
- 🔓 **Loss of context** – The signature would lose the binding to a specific app, version, or chain.

This is why the **domain separator** acts like a “digital fingerprint” that ties the signature to:
- a specific DApp,
- a specific contract,
- a specific blockchain.

### ✅ Example from the EIP-712 spec:

```solidity
keccak256(
  abi.encode(
    keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"),
    keccak256(bytes("Uniswap V2")),
    keccak256(bytes("1")),
    1,
    address(this)
  )
)
```

---

### ✅ Real proof:

- In **Uniswap's `permit()`** implementation, if you change the chainId or contract address, the signature becomes invalid.
- In **EIP-2612**, the domain separator ensures that the permit is valid **only for that token**, on that chain.
